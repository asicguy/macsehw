# rom

This directory can contain ROM dumps of the Macintosh SE's main system
firmware boot ROM that is directly accessible to the CPU.  However,
due to their uncertain copyright status, they are currently not
included in the repository.

Additionally, links to other projects to provide a modern replacement
ROM for the Macintosh SE are also provided here.
