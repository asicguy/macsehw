Macintosh Family Hardware
=========================

What???  Is this for real?  Indeed, it is.  Not only am I hardware
assembling information on my particular model that I own, the
Macintosh SE, but now I'm expanding to cover other models too.  Not to
mention, there is a high degree of similiarity in the RTC chip design,
so why not have just one repo for them all?  Besides, as it turns out,
I need to reference schematics from related Macintoshes to be able to
assemble the complete schematics for the Macintosh SE.
