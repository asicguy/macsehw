This directory contains models of the original boxing that the
Macintosh SE was sold in.  "Shipping container" in technical terms.
These are tuned to be nice "printable" designs: cardboard printing and
cutting for the cardboard box design and 3D printing or CNC routing
for the expanded polystyrene.
