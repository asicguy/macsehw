Nikon D7000, Nikon DX format sensor size (i.e. APS-C format).  The
EXIF data claims there was a 50mm prime lens (>>DATA<<) attached.
HOWEVER, because we're not at infinity focus, the close focus effect
approximately halves the field of view.  Otherwise I can't get the
unproject perspective to work out correctly from the photos for the
foam blocks.  That calculates to a horizontal field of view of 14
degrees, and using the box dimensions to scale the proportions, the
lens aperture was about 5 feet from the ground, which means that you
must be about 6 feet tall standing up straight.  That all sounds like
sane values.
